# Mokei MCP toolkit

Mokei is a toolkit for creating, interacting and monitoring clients and servers using the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

## What is MCP?

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) is a protocol specifying interactions between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external systems to enhance the possibilities of LLM interactions.

## Why MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is an [open standard](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/) created by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) and supported by their [Claude for Desktop application](https://claude.ai/download). As such, it has the backing of a major AI company while being fully free to use by anyone.

Using MCP allows developers to create solutions that can integrate with a wider ecosystem without particular restrictions, benefiting from the stability and flexibility offered by an open standard. This, in turn, enables more innovative and robust interactions between LLMs and external systems.

## Why Mokei?

### Easily create MCP servers, clients and hosts

The [Mokei libraries](./api.mdx) help create MCP servers and clients, as well as hosts spawning servers and managing their lifecycle. 

### Proxy and monitor client-server interactions

The Mokei Monitor is a Web UI running locally that allows you to monitor the interactions between your MCP clients and servers using a local proxy.

### Interact with models running locally

The [Mokei CLI](./cli.mdx) provides a simple integration with [Ollama](https://ollama.com/), allowing to provide MCP servers to conversations with models running locally.
